# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
Vulnerability Scanner is a comprehensive tool designed for penetration testers to identify potential weaknesses within a system. Our software scans multiple types of entities, including IP addresses, domain/sub-domain names, Bitcoin addresses, personal names, usernames, phone numbers, and email addresses. This allows users to evaluate various security challenges and assess where a system might be vulnerable to attacks or misuse.

## Features
